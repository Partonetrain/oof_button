# Oof Button

This is a silly mod that adds the ability to make the classic Minecraft hurt sound effect (AKA Steve Oof) with the press of a button.

In the config, you can additionally choose different sounds from a list of included sounds, and the pitch of the sound.
Other players will hear your choice of sound and pitch in multiplayer.
Use the Configured mod for an in-game configuration menu.
