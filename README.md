# Oof Button

This is a silly mod that adds the ability to make the classic Minecraft hurt sound effect (AKA Steve Oof) with the press of a button (G by default).
Subtitles will indicate the name of the player who made the sound effect.

Additionally, in the config, you can choose different sounds from a list of included sounds, and the pitch of the sound.
Other players will hear your choice of sound and pitch in multiplayer (assuming everyone and the server have the mod installed).
Use the Configured mod for an in-game configuration menu.

*Requires Common Network*
